# Hidden ZeroDivisionError in Python

This repository demonstrates a subtle and uncommon error in Python: a `ZeroDivisionError` that's hidden within a conditional statement.  The error only occurs under a specific circumstance, making it harder to identify.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of thorough error handling and careful consideration of edge cases when writing code.
